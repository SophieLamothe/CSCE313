File transfer time for 100MB file:

File: test_100MB.bin
File size: 100 100MB
Time taken: 18,292 ms

What is the main bottleneck?
The main bottleneck appears to be the buffer size used during the trasnfer. Since
we are transfering in chunks of 256 bytes, the client and the server must communicate
multiple times to transfer all chunks of the file. Increasing the buffer size would
like reduce the amount of I/0 operations to speed up the transfer. Factors like CPU
usage may also contribute to the delay.
